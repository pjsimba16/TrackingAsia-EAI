<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

TrackingAsia was developed by researchers at the Asian Development Bank. The purpose in designing the framework was to complement toolkits of governments, businesses, investors, and analysts for monitoring current economic conditions and their likely direction.

The business cycle, represented by fluctuations in real GDP per capita around a long-term estimated trend, can gauge the state of an economy. But data on real GDP are often not timely and hence the grasp of overall cyclical conditions is not as current as required for real-time decision making. Even though GDP of the previous quarter is released with fairly long lags in many Asian economies, other statistical indicators are available every month that contain an abundance of information about activity in various sectors and the aggregate economy.

The TrackingAsia project designed the Economic Activity Index (EAI) as an indicator to capture economic activity so that business cycles can be tracked monthly. The predicted metric draws data series for each economy from six categories and sectors—consumption, investment, trade, government, financial, and the external sector—and identifies the broad groups that are driving economic expansions and downturns, historically and currently.

The goal of this project was to allow governments, businesses, investors and analysts to generate EAI figures for their respective economies using their own data. To do this, we built a Python based executable that allows users to interact with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) when generating EAI analyses. With this tool on hand, non-programmers are able to utilize the machine learning framework developed by ADB researchers for economic cycle tracking on the TrackingAsia website using various models on their personalized datasets, allowing for a more simple and flexible business cycle tracking tool.
